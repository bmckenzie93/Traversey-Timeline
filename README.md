this better work this time!

So far today I have learned that when using GitHub I should create a remote repository first, then clone it onto my local computer, add my work to it, commit the changes locally, then push it to my GitHub. 

I was doing it wrong and running into error after error about the histories not matching or something else equally as frustrating.
